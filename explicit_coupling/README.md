Now that LS-DYNA is installed the coupling can begin. 
Here the LS-DYNA solver is coupled with a c++ dummy. 
Paste the code from the `.f` file in the appropriate places in the dyn.21 file and run LS-DYNA with cube_userload.k as the input file. Afterwards the c++ dummy should be able to connect to LS-DYNA.
